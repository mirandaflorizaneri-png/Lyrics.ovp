# Flor — Music & Lyrics

A small static web project that includes markup, styles, and client-side JavaScript to present music and accompanying lyrics.

## Overview

This repository is a simple front-end demo containing a web page (`index.html`) along with JavaScript (`script.js`) and CSS (`style.css`). It can be used as a small music/lyrics showcase or starting point for enhancements.

## Features
- Lightweight static site using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Displays music and lyrics with a simple interactive UI (depending on implementation in `script.js`)

## Project structure
- `index.html` - Main webpage
- `script.js` - Client-side behavior and interactions
- `style.css` - Visual styling and layout rules

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page locally.

If you'd rather serve it from a local development server, you can run a simple HTTP server:

PowerShell / cmd:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Or (Node):

```
npx http-server .
```

## Development

- Edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript files directly to iterate quickly.
- Consider using a lightweight server for features that require a running server (like fetch requests or audio streaming).

## Contributing

- Fork the repo, create a branch for your change, and open a pull request.
- Follow the existing file structure and keep styles and scripts organized.
